# Mammotion Luba

## Pros

* My map looks fantastic and is exactly correct in the app versus real world.
* Doing the initial mapping is very easy and very accurate.
* The mower is seemingly magically accurate when doing lines, they’ve done an impressive job with this!
* Great job with all wheel drive too. My terrain isn’t too bad, but I’ve seen other videos with crazy hills that the mower has conquered, impressive job.
* Very good at docking with the charger by itself, haven’t had a single issue with this.
* Only time the mower has gotten stuck is when I had large and unmarked objects on the border. However, I was able to push the continue button on the app and it fixed itself without any other intervention. It’d be nice if I could get a push notice about this.
* Cutting height is automatically set via app.
* If the mower is currently getting worse reception it starts to slow itself down.
* Editing zones is very easy and intuitive for the most part.

## FAQ
### How well does it really work?
Honestly, I'm kind of blown away at how well it works. Even after watching some peoples' youtube videos, I was skeptical, but holy hell, when it's working it's near perfect.

### Do you feel confident leaving it running when going away for a week?
Not yet, but I think I will soon. On a counter note, I was never confident about leaving my Landroid alone for even a couple days let alone a week. I had to babysit that thing like there’s no tomorrow. Right now I have my charging station up against my house which sometimes can cause poor reception when starting scheduled tasks. I think this is either solvable by moving my base station away from the house or maybe even via a software/firmware update. However, once your areas can be mowed successfully, I think you should feel confident about it when you need to leave for a week. I think a worst case scenario might be something like a storm knocking huge limbs down that may obstruct your mower and cause it to be stuck.

### Will it go rogue and go out of bounds in the street or a neighbor’s yard?
Despite all of the minor glitches I've encountered, this is the one thing I'm surprisingly most confident about. Initially before mounting my dish on the top of my shed, I staked it in the ground next to my house where it had very poor reception. Let me tell you, this thing will NOT fucking move if it remotely thinks it has poor reception. If it gets even slightly confused about its location, it will dead stop until the signal gets better. In fact I'll even say that I'm more confident that this thing will recover and not end up in the street versus my old Landroid with its sliding over the boundary wire on hills.

### Are you nervous about the company’s future?
This is fair to feel, but at the same time, I think it works so well that they'd have to have some sort of sabotage at this point to fail. There are definitely several glitches that might make this a frustrating experience for the average person (new to robot mowers). However let me be clear, they are significantly less than the hassles and glitches of my previous Landroid L.

### What about repairs and maintenance?
Their website says: “All the main parts of the lawn mower and battery are covered under a 2-year warranty. Please note that the accessories (Charging Station and RTK Antenna) are under a 1-year warranty. The warranty period for a product is valid on the day when product(s) are delivered.” Because I have only received and started using my mower, I have zero experience with their support. I can say that I had an extremely positive support call with Worx Landroid support in the past. Their support was so good and professional that if Mammotion’s support was at least 25% as good, I’d be satisfied.
